      <h2>HOW TO PLAY SLAPJACK</h2>
      <h3>The Goal of SlapJack is to Win All 52 Cards in the Deck. Here's How It Works:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The game starts when the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 26 cards</li>
        <li>The players take turns dealing their cards face up, one-at-a-time to a pile in the center</li>
        <li>Players can "slap" the central pile to claim it and then shuffle those new cards into their existing hand</li>
        <li>There are 3 valid slaps in SlapJack:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>When a Jack is the top card</li>
            <li>On doubles - two cards of the same number in a row</li>
            <li>On sandwiches - two matching cards with a random card between them</li>
          </ol>
        <li>If a player slaps the central pile for any other reason, they forfeit the top card in their hand. That card is then added to the bottom of the other player's hand</li>
        <li>When a player runs out of cards the game continues with an elimination round, but with different rules:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The player with cards continues to deal their cards to the middle without alternating turns</li>
            <li>Both players can slap at any time, but Jacks are now the only valid slap</li>
            <li>If the player without cards slaps anything besides a Jack, the player with cards wins</li>
            <li>If the player with cards slaps anything besides a Jack, they forfeit their top card to the player without cards</li>
            <li>If the player with cards slaps a Jack first, they win the game</li>
            <li>If the player without cards slaps a Jack first, they pick up the central pile, and the game's original rules now apply again</li>
            <li>If no one slaps a Jack before the player with cards deals all of theirs to the central pile, that player picks up all 52 of them, shuffles them, and then continues to deal those cards to the middle for another elimination round</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Notes About This Particular Game:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>See "Your Controls:" for each player to understand how this game can be operated</li>
        <li>The dealer will do ALL of the shuffling for you and, in a "close call", will judge who slapped first to ensure that the game proceeds fairly</li>
        <li>The dealer will notify the player's regarding who's turn it is and provide updates about all in-game results, including slap outcomes and wins. The dealer allows for a 3-second break between games, giving players time to reset</li>
        <li>The delaer will remember the win score even after the players have left the game, so the tournament can be picked up later!</li>
        <li>You may play as many games as you like :)</li>
      </ul>
